(50mph - 0 mph)/0.25s = 89.4 m/s^2

This is about 9.116g which is the WORST CASE because 50mph is the max speed so the 
Adafruit LIS3DH Triple-Axis Accelerometer (+-2g/4g/8g/16g) [ADA2809] 
should work just fine


This speed is more ideal 
(40mph - 0mph)/ 0.25s = 71.5 m/s^2 
This is about 7.291g so range should be from 2 to 8, but anything past 6 should shut it down
